# State-Transition-model
The state-transiton model enable us to analyze the structue-function relationship in neuronal networks, based on the Markov chain model. The main paper is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16582).  

## Installation
All code is writen in MATLAB. Plese prepare the its lisence.

1. Clone this repository in command line.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MonmaNobuaki/State-transition-model.git
```

2. Go into the repository.
```bash
cd State-transition-model
```

# Caution 
If you want to analuze the network with more than 16-nodes, you need st least 32 GB RAM. This is because the steta-transition matrix .


## Usage
If you want to analuze the network with more than 16-nodes, you have to prepare enough RAM.

Please execute the script with the following command

```bash
python dcimg2btf.py
```
